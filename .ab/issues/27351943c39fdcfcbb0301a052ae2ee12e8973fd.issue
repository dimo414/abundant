This\nis good as the default, but other workflows are necessary, the specifics\nof this functionality and how to implement it still need to be worked out.\n\nSome options:\nOnly the creator can close an issue, others resolving it assigns it back to creator.\n\"resolving\" changes the status and assigns it to someone else (QA) who can then close it.",
